 *
 * Purpose of this Project:
 * To let the user play the Sudoku game while having a maximum
 * of 5 mistakes allowed
 *
 * List of the methods in this program:
 *
 * 1. displaySudoku:
 * This  method displays a 2D array, the Sudoku grid, with the number of the
 * rows and columns, and the zeros are displayed as spaces
 *
 * 2. generateEmptyElementsArray:
 * This method takes a 2D array and returns a 2D array with elements equal to 1
 * if its corresponding elements in the parameter is different than 0
 * Otherwise, the elements are equal to 0
 *
 * 3. countMissedValues:
 * This method takes a 2D array and returns the number of the values that are
 * equal to zero in the parameter
 * (the return value is the number of values that must be guessed by the player)
 *
 * 4. addValueInACell:
 * This method receives a value to be added and the coordinates of the cell of
 * the Sudoku grid in which the value is to be stored
 * It calls the methods existInRow, existInCol and existInBlock that check the
 * uniqueness of this value in the related row, column and block (3 x 3)
 * If the value doesn't exist in the same row, column and block, it is stored in
 * the cell
 * Otherwise, no change occurs to the grid
 * The return value will be explained in detail later on
 *
 * 5. existInRow:
 * This method checks if its parameter num exists or not in the row (row) of the
 * parameter sud (2D array)
 *
 * 6. existInCol:
 * This method checks if its parameter num exists or not in the column (col) of
 * the parameter sud (2D array)
 *
 * 7. existInBlock:
 * This method checks if its parameter num exists or not in the block related to
 * the parameters row and col
 *
 * 8. runGame:
 * This method is the method that connects all the other methods in order to run
 * the game properly; the game ends when the user wins or loses all of his/her
 * attempts
 *
 * 9. the main method:
 * It contains the 2D array that represents the grid of the Sudoku
 * It calls the method runGame using that array
 *
